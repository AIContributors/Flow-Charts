# Flow-Charts
A Flow network for universal cycling. 

This will be a network flow for circulation. Originally easy to write in python language (or use any suitable if you want. Must add in initial comments). Contribution to it doesn't need to add initial statements and functions. You can contribute to any network flow which turns again same like a cycle or circulation. For example; Cycle of Birth and Death, and/or cycle of relations, cycle or life process, the cycle of a full day (default) etc.

This simple programming concept help AI to know the things better and use same functioning methods to work and learn more. We'll use this programming concept to build the AI Better. Your contribution will give you a batch of a contributor to AI.

# What are we Doing?

We are building a Computer Operating System which will initially start own segment and controls faster than others. This will be open source Operating System cloud-based and offline or local base. Since AI is a very vast and bigger topic we need your help to make it fast. This will be open source for local personal uses and will act same like an intelligent human. So we are inviting you to contribute a very very small amount of software coding in any preferred language. Generally, You can use Python, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, C, Cpp, Java, Or suitable JavaScripts, HTML5, CSS3, PHP5+ Languages.

# What you have to do?

Submit your small part of code without initial statements and functions. It's a network flow so doesn't need other things. We'll add it for you in your code.

If you have a private code and don't want to share with people please mail me at yuwrajjr@gmail.com

# Generally how your coding must starts?

Use any suitable preferred language.

Start with;

if {}

endif {}
or
elif{}

else:

# Check This

1. Use network flow example relate directly to real life
2. Must check bugs and error
3. Add code when you are done writting correct one
4. Your Contribution to AI Development will be very very helpful to further process a simple task
5. AI mostly works on Flow network so we are inviting you to add your own
6. Any common or known flow you can add
7. If you haven't known about languages, go to https://www.codecademy.com/ to learn
8. If you don't want to learn just message me at yuwrajjr@gmail.com with your flow chart
9. Flowchart must be original and bugs free
10. Don't submit already submitted
11. Add your own branch if working on big projects otherwise just add a file and must add a suitable title to your file
